<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Consistent source code indentation is crucial for code readability, even in
free-form languages that are oblivious to whitespace. However, as in a free-form
language programmers can format the code as they desire, this may lead to
mismatched indentation styles. Automatic code formatters address this problem by
rewriting code to a standard layout, however they impose a specific style and
only work for syntactically valid code.</p>
<p>We describe an extension of Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs) that can model
indentation information and we show that it can be used to specify different
indentation styles. A parser based on such extension can check for indentation
inconsistencies and inform the developer about them. To evaluate our approach,
we also implemented a full parser for the Lua programming language and used it
to parse a well-known Lua codebase. We observed that 98% of source code lines
were well-indented according to our specification.</p>
