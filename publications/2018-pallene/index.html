<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The simplicity and flexibility of dynamic languages make
them popular for prototyping and scripting, but the lack of
compile-time type information makes it very challenging to
generate efficient executable code.</p>
<p>Inspired by ideas from scripting, just-in-time compilers,
and optional type systems, we are developing Pallene, a
statically typed companion language to the Lua scripting
language. Pallene is designed to be amenable to standard
ahead-of-time compilation techniques, to interoperate seamlessly
with Lua (even sharing its runtime), and to be familiar
to Lua programmers.</p>
<p>In this paper, we compare the performance of the Pallene
compiler against LuaJIT, a just in time compiler for Lua, and
with C extension modules. The results suggest that Pallene
can achieve similar levels of performance.</p>
